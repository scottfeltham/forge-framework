# Credits and Acknowledgments

FORGE Framework stands on the shoulders of giants. We acknowledge and thank the following influences:

## Foundational Inspirations

### Modern Software Engineering (Book)
**Author**: David Farley  
**Contribution**: Core principles of continuous delivery, managing complexity, and the importance of fast feedback loops. The book's emphasis on simplicity and effectiveness over elaborate processes directly shaped FORGE's minimalist approach.

### BMAD Method
**Full Name**: Business Modeling for Agile Development  
**Contribution**: The structured phase-based approach to development cycles. BMAD's clear progression through analysis, design, and implementation phases inspired FORGE's five-phase structure.

### Agent-OS
**Type**: AI Agent Architecture Pattern  
**Contribution**: Demonstrated how specialized AI agents can collaborate effectively. This pattern inspired FORGE's approach of having distinct agents (Architect, Developer, Tester, DevOps, Reviewer) for different aspects of development.

## Key Concepts Borrowed

1. **From Modern Software Engineering**:
   - Continuous feedback over big-bang delivery
   - Simplicity as a design goal
   - Automation of repetitive tasks
   - Focus on developer experience

2. **From BMAD**:
   - Clear phase delineation
   - Iterative refinement
   - Business-focused outcomes
   - Structured yet flexible process

3. **From Agent-OS**:
   - Specialized agent roles
   - AI-driven coordination
   - Natural language interfaces
   - Distributed intelligence

## Our Innovation

While deeply inspired by these sources, FORGE's unique contribution is:
- Reducing the entire framework to under 100 lines of code
- Using markdown as the primary state management system
- Making conversation the primary interface
- Optimizing for AI-human collaboration

## Thank You

To David Farley for showing that engineering excellence and simplicity go hand in hand.

To the BMAD community for proving that structure and agility can coexist.

To the Agent-OS pioneers for demonstrating the power of AI agent architectures.

And to the open source community for continually pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
