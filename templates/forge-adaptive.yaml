# AI configuration with model selection
ai:

  # Model selection strategy

  # Available models
  models:
    default: sonnet          # For routine tasks
    complex: opus            # For complex reasoning
    fallback: sonnet         # When preferred model unavailable

# Agent configuration

# Learning configuration
learning:
  memory_integration: true
  claude_md: true
  track_model_effectiveness: true  # Learn which model works best

# Cost management (optional)

  opus_percentage_limit: 20  # Limit Opus to 20% of requests
  
# Let AI analyze project and refine these settings
