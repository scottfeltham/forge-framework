# Gradual adoption strategy
adoption:
  phase_1:
    - Use FORGE for documentation only
    - Run `forge learn` commands
    - Create CLAUDE.md for context
    
  phase_2:
    - Try `forge new` for one small feature
    - Use Focus and Evaluate phases only
    - Document learnings
    
  phase_3:
    - Enable more phases as comfortable
    - Create specialized agents as needed
    - Integrate with existing CI/CD
    
  phase_4:
    - Full FORGE workflow
    - Team collaboration features
    - Automated learning system

# Notes for team
team_notes: |
  FORGE has been added in "gradual adoption" mode.
  
  Start with:
  1. `forge learn claude` - Create AI context file
  2. `forge new "small-feature"` - Try on low-risk feature
  3. `forge learn retrospective` - After first feature
  
  FORGE will not interfere with existing workflow.
  Use what helps, ignore what doesn't.
  
# Rollback plan
rollback:
  - Simply remove forge.yaml and .forge/ directory
  - All existing code and processes remain unchanged
  - No dependencies on FORGE for critical operations
