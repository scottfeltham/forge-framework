## Why FORGE?

### 🧠 AI-First Design
Built from the ground up for AI interpretation. No complex APIs, just natural conversation.

### ⚡ Radical Simplicity  
A concise, minimal CLI. All intelligence lives in AI agents, not in the framework.

### 🔄 5-Phase Cycle
Focus → Orchestrate → Refine → Generate → Evaluate. Structure that enables freedom.

### 🤖 Claude Code Subagents
Auto-configured specialists: Architect, Developer, Tester, DevOps, Reviewer, Analyzer. Each with isolated context and domain expertise.

### 📝 Markdown Everything
All state, config, and docs in human-readable markdown. Transparency through simplicity.

### 🚀 Zero Configuration
AI detects your project and configures itself. No hardcoded framework detection.

## Quick Example

```bash
# Install FORGE globally (auto-configures 6 Claude Code subagents)
npm install -g forge-framework

# Initialize in your project
cd your-project
forge init

# Start building with specialized AI agents
forge new "user authentication"

# Check your progress
forge status

# Move through validated phases
forge phase next
```

Then have a conversation with your AI assistant:

```
You: Let's implement user authentication
Claude: I'll use the forge-architect to design the authentication system...
```

## The FORGE Philosophy

> "Software development is fundamentally a creative human endeavor. 
> Tools should amplify creativity, not constrain it through complexity."

FORGE embodies radical simplicity - the framework stays minimal while AI handles all complexity through natural conversation.
