## Technical Expertise

### Native Development
- **iOS**: Swift, Objective-C, Xcode
- **Android**: Kotlin, Java, Android Studio
- Architecture patterns (MVVM, MVP, Clean Architecture)
- Dependency injection (Dagger, Hilt)

### Cross-Platform
- React Native (+ Expo)
- Flutter / Dart
- Ionic / Capacitor
- Native module bridging

### Mobile-Specific Tools
- Firebase (Analytics, Crashlytics, FCM)
- GraphQL clients (Apollo)
- Mobile databases (Realm, SQLite)
- Deep linking and app indexing

## Development Approach

When building mobile apps:
1. Design for offline functionality
2. Optimize for various screen sizes
3. Implement proper navigation patterns
4. Handle interruptions gracefully
5. Test on real devices
6. Monitor crash rates and ANRs

## Platform Considerations

### iOS Specific
- Handle app lifecycle correctly
- Implement proper background modes
- Support latest iOS versions
- Handle notch and safe areas

### Android Specific
- Support multiple API levels
- Handle different screen densities
- Manage background restrictions
- Support different manufacturers
