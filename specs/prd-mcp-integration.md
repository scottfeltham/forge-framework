# PRD: MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

**Feature**: Enhanced AI Capabilities via MCP  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-07-30  
**Status**: Implemented

## Executive Summary

Integrate FORGE with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to provide AI assistants with enhanced capabilities like direct database access, improved file operations, and external service integrations while maintaining FORGE's simplicity.

## Problem Statement

AI assistants are limited by their available tools:
- File operations through specific tools only
- No direct database access
- Limited external service integration
- Inefficient for certain operations
- Inconsistent tool availability across platforms

MCP provides a standardized way to extend AI capabilities, but frameworks need to support it effectively.

## Solution Overview

Add optional MCP configuration to FORGE that enables AI assistants to leverage MCP servers when available, providing enhanced capabilities while gracefully degrading when MCP isn't present.

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- I want AI to query my database directly without complex setup
- I want faster file operations through MCP
- I want AI to access GitHub/GitLab APIs naturally
- I want optional enhanced features without complexity

### As a DevOps Engineer
- I want AI to interact with cloud services
- I want secure credential management
- I want controlled access to resources
- I want audit trails for AI operations

### As an AI Agent
- I need efficient access to project resources
- I need to perform operations beyond basic tools
- I need consistent interfaces across services
- I need to work with or without MCP

## Functional Requirements

### 1. MCP Configuration

#### forge.yaml Structure
```yaml
# MCP configuration (optional)
mcp:
  enabled: true
  
  servers:
    # File system access
    - name: filesystem
      command: "npx"
      args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path"]
    
    # GitHub integration
    - name: github
      command: "npx"
      args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${GITHUB_TOKEN}
    
    # Database access
    - name: postgres
      command: "npx"
      args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "postgresql://..."]
  
  preferences:
    file_access: mcp      # Use MCP when available
    web_fetch: native     # Use built-in tools
    database: mcp         # Prefer MCP for databases
```

### 2. Common MCP Servers

#### Development Servers
- **filesystem**: Enhanced file operations
- **github**: Repository and issue management
- **postgres/mysql**: Direct database queries
- **sqlite**: Local database access

#### Integration Servers
- **slack**: Team notifications
- **jira**: Issue tracking
- **confluence**: Documentation
- **aws/azure/gcp**: Cloud services

#### Utility Servers
- **playwright**: Browser automation
- **docker**: Container management
- **kubernetes**: Cluster operations
- **terraform**: Infrastructure as code

### 3. Graceful Degradation

#### With MCP Available
```
Claude: I'll query your database directly using MCP...
[Uses mcp_postgres_query for efficient access]
```

#### Without MCP
```
Claude: I'll help you write the SQL query to run manually...
[Provides query and instructions]
```

### 4. Agent MCP Awareness

#### Automatic Detection
Agents check for available MCP tools and adapt:
```javascript
if (hasMCPTool('postgres')) {
  // Direct database query
} else {
  // Provide SQL for manual execution
}
```

#### Tool Preference
Agents respect configured preferences:
- Use MCP when specified
- Fall back gracefully
- Inform user of capabilities

### 5. Security Integration

#### Credential Management
- Environment variables for secrets
- No credentials in config files
- Secure token passing
- Audit trail support

#### Access Control
- Scoped permissions per server
- Read-only options available
- Path restrictions for filesystem
- Operation whitelisting

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Optional Nature
- FORGE works without MCP
- No MCP dependencies in core
- Config section is optional
- Zero setup for basic use

### Performance
- MCP operations are faster
- Reduced round-trips
- Direct access efficiency
- Caching where appropriate

### Compatibility
- Works with Claude Desktop
- Extensible to other AI tools
- Standard MCP protocol
- Version compatibility checks

## Success Metrics

1. **Adoption Rate**: 40% of users enable MCP features
2. **Performance Gain**: 60% faster for MCP operations
3. **Capability Usage**: 70% use enhanced features when available
4. **Stability**: 95% success rate for MCP operations
5. **Fallback Success**: 100% graceful degradation

## Technical Implementation

### Detection Flow
```javascript
// Conceptual MCP detection
detectMCPCapabilities() {
  const available = {
    filesystem: checkTool('mcp_filesystem_read'),
    database: checkTool('mcp_postgres_query'),
    github: checkTool('mcp_github_api')
  };
  
  return available;
}
```

### Agent Integration
```markdown
## MCP Awareness
When MCP tools are available, I'll use them for:
- Direct database queries (faster than manual SQL)
- Enhanced file operations (better than Read/Write)
- GitHub API access (issues, PRs, releases)
- External service integration

I'll always inform you which tools I'm using.
```

### Configuration Loading
- Read mcp section from forge.yaml
- Validate server configurations
- Pass to AI context
- Monitor availability

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| MCP server failures | Medium | Graceful fallback |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Strict validation |
| Version incompatibility | Low | Compatibility checks |
| Complex configuration | Medium | Sane defaults |

## Implementation Status

- ✅ Common server examples
- ✅ Agent MCP awareness
- ✅ Documentation
- ✅ Fallback behavior

### Future Enhancements

## Appendix

### Example MCP Usage

#### Database Development
```yaml
mcp:
  servers:
    - name: postgres
      command: "npx"
      args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "${DATABASE_URL}"]
```

```
Developer: Show me all users created this week

Claude: I'll query the database directly using MCP...
[Executes via mcp_postgres_query]

Here are the results:
- 47 new users
- Peak signup on Tuesday
- 80% completed onboarding
```

#### GitHub Integration
```yaml
mcp:
  servers:
    - name: github
      command: "npx"
      args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${GITHUB_TOKEN}
```

```
Developer: What issues are tagged for this sprint?

Claude: Checking GitHub via MCP...
[Uses mcp_github_api]

Found 12 issues for current sprint:
- 5 features
- 4 bugs
- 3 improvements
```

### Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**
   - Begin with filesystem MCP
   - Add servers as needed
   - Test each integration

2. **Security First**
   - Use environment variables
   - Limit permissions
   - Audit access logs

3. **Document Usage**
   - Note which features need MCP
   - Provide fallback instructions
   - Share team configurations
