# PRD: GitHub Release Automation

## Product Requirements Document

**Feature Name**: Automated Package Release Pipeline  
**Date**: 2025-07-30  
**Status**: In Development  
**Owner**: FORGE Framework Team

## Executive Summary

Implement a fully automated CI/CD pipeline that triggers on Git tag creation to build, test, and release the FORGE framework package to npm and GitHub releases. This will streamline the release process, ensure consistency, and reduce manual errors.

## Problem Statement

Currently, releasing a new version of FORGE requires manual steps:
- Running tests locally
- Building the package
- Publishing to npm
- Creating GitHub releases
- Writing release notes

This manual process is:
- Error-prone
- Time-consuming
- Inconsistent
- Lacks automated security checks

## Goals

1. **Automate Release Process**: One tag push triggers entire release pipeline
2. **Ensure Quality**: Mandatory test passing before release
3. **Improve Security**: Automated vulnerability scanning
4. **Standardize Releases**: Consistent release notes and versioning
5. **Support Multiple Channels**: Both stable and beta releases

## Non-Goals

- Not implementing custom package registry
- Not changing the versioning strategy
- Not implementing rollback mechanisms (separate feature)
- Not automating version bumping (developer decides version)

## User Stories

### As a Maintainer
- I want to release new versions with a single git tag
- I want confidence that releases are tested and secure
- I want automated changelog generation
- I want to support both stable and beta releases

### As a Contributor
- I want to see clear release notes
- I want to understand what changed between versions
- I want to know releases are properly tested

### As a User
- I want reliable package releases
- I want to access both stable and beta versions
- I want comprehensive release notes
- I want to trust the security of releases

## Functional Requirements

### Trigger Mechanism
- Activate on push of tags matching `v*` pattern
- Validate semantic versioning format
- Distinguish stable vs pre-release versions

### Build Pipeline
1. **Environment Setup**
   - Node.js LTS versions
   - Cross-platform testing
   - Dependency installation

2. **Quality Checks**
   - Run full test suite
   - Code linting
   - Type checking (if applicable)
   - Security vulnerability scanning

3. **Package Building**
   - Generate distributable package
   - Create source maps
   - Bundle documentation

4. **Release Creation**
   - Publish to npm registry
   - Create GitHub release
   - Upload release assets
   - Generate release notes

### Release Notes Generation
- Parse commits since last tag
- Group by conventional commit types
- Highlight breaking changes
- Include contributor credits
- Link to relevant issues/PRs

### Security Requirements
- Scan for known vulnerabilities
- Check for exposed secrets
- Verify package integrity
- Use secure token storage
- Implement least-privilege access

## Technical Requirements

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: Release
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'
```

### Required Secrets
- `NPM_TOKEN`: For npm publishing
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: For release creation (provided by Actions)

### Supported Platforms
- Ubuntu (latest)
- Windows (latest)
- macOS (latest)

### Node.js Versions
- Current LTS versions
- Latest stable version

## Success Metrics

1. **Release Time**: < 10 minutes from tag to published
2. **Success Rate**: > 95% successful releases
3. **Security**: Zero vulnerabilities in releases
4. **Adoption**: All releases use automated pipeline
5. **Quality**: No manual hotfixes required

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Token Compromise
**Mitigation**: Use GitHub secrets, rotate regularly, audit access

### Risk: Bad Release Published
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive test suite, manual approval for major versions

### Risk: Platform-Specific Failures
**Mitigation**: Test on all platforms, provide platform status matrix

### Risk: npm Registry Downtime
**Mitigation**: Implement retry logic, provide status notifications

## Timeline

### Phase 1: Basic Automation (Week 1)
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Basic test and build
- npm publishing

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Week 2)
- Changelog generation
- Security scanning
- Multi-platform testing

### Phase 3: Polish (Week 3)
- Release notes formatting
- Error handling
- Documentation

## Dependencies

- GitHub Actions
- npm registry access
- Conventional commits adoption
- Security scanning tools

## Open Questions

1. Should major versions require manual approval?
2. How long to support old Node.js versions?
3. Should we sign releases with GPG?
4. Implement rollback mechanism?
