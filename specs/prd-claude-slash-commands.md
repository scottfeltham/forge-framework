# PRD: Claude Slash Commands for FORGE Framework

## Executive Summary

Implement slash command support in Claude Code to make FORGE commands explicit and unmissable in natural conversation, addressing the learning that conversational commands can be overlooked.

## Problem Statement

From our learnings:
- FORGE commands like "forge a new X" blend so naturally into conversation that AI assistants can miss them
- This leads to bypassing the FORGE process and losing cycle tracking
- Users may not get the full benefit of the framework's structure

## Solution Overview

Create a slash command system for Claude Code that:
1. Provides explicit command recognition with `/forge-*` pattern
2. Maintains compatibility with natural language commands
3. Offers clear visual feedback and command discovery
4. Integrates seamlessly into Claude's conversational interface

## Detailed Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Commands
1. `/forge init` - Initialize FORGE in current directory
2. `/forge new <feature>` - Start new development cycle
3. `/forge status` - Show current cycle(s) status
4. `/forge complete [file]` - Complete and archive cycle
5. `/forge learn [action]` - Access learning system
6. `/forge document` - Start documentation session
7. `/forge help` - Show available commands

#### Command Features
- Auto-completion suggestions when typing `/forge`
- Parameter hints for commands requiring arguments
- Clear error messages for invalid usage
- Help text for each command with `--help` flag

#### Integration Requirements
- Commands work alongside natural language
- Preserve conversational context
- Support command chaining
- Work in both solo and team modes

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Command recognition < 100ms
   - No noticeable lag in conversation

2. **Usability**
   - Clear visual distinction for commands
   - Intuitive parameter syntax
   - Helpful error messages

3. **Compatibility**
   - Works with existing FORGE installations
   - Backward compatible with natural language

## Technical Design

### Implementation Approach

Since Claude Code doesn't have a traditional plugin system:

1. **Command Definition Files**
   ```
   .claude/
   ├── COMMANDS.md              # Main command system documentation
   └── commands/
       └── forge/              # FORGE-specific commands
           ├── init.md
           ├── new.md
           ├── status.md
           ├── complete.md
           ├── learn.md
           ├── document.md
           └── help.md
   ```

2. **CLAUDE.md Integration**
   - Add section on recognizing slash commands
   - Define command patterns and responses
   - Provide execution templates

3. **Recognition Pattern**
   ```
   /forge <command> [parameters]
   ```

### Command Structure

Each command file contains:
- Command pattern
- Parameter definitions
- Execution template
- Help text
- Examples

### Example Command Definition

```markdown
# /forge new

## Pattern
/forge new <feature-name>

## Parameters
- feature-name: Required. Name of the feature to develop

## Execution
1. Create cycle file at .forge/current.md
2. Use feature name in template
3. Show confirmation message

## Help
Starts a new FORGE development cycle for the specified feature.

## Examples
/forge new authentication-system
/forge new "user profile page"
```

## Success Metrics

1. **Adoption**: 80% of FORGE commands use slash syntax within 1 month
2. **Recognition**: 100% slash command recognition rate
3. **Errors**: <5% command error rate
4. **Satisfaction**: Positive user feedback on clarity

## Rollout Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Create command definition structure
2. Update CLAUDE.md with patterns
3. Test basic recognition

### Phase 2: Implementation  
1. Implement all core commands
2. Add help system
3. Create documentation

### Phase 3: Enhancement
1. Add auto-completion hints
2. Implement command suggestions
3. Gather user feedback

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Commands feel unnatural | Low adoption | Keep natural language support |
| Claude doesn't recognize patterns | Feature fails | Clear documentation and patterns |
| Conflicts with other slash commands | Confusion | Use unique prefix `/forge ` |

## Future Enhancements

1. **Rich UI Integration**
   - Command palette visualization
   - Interactive parameter selection

2. **Advanced Commands**
   - `/forge analyze` - AI project analysis
   - `/forge suggest` - Next action suggestions
   - `/forge review` - Trigger code review

3. **Customization**
   - User-defined command aliases
   - Project-specific commands

## Dependencies

- CLAUDE.md file for instructions
- Claude's ability to read project files
- Existing FORGE command structure

## Timeline

- Week 1: Create command structure and basic recognition
- Week 2: Implement all commands and help system
- Week 3: Testing and documentation
- Week 4: Gather feedback and iterate

## Approval

This PRD addresses the key learning that FORGE's conversational nature can lead to missed commands. By adding explicit slash commands while maintaining natural language support, we get the best of both worlds: clear command recognition and conversational flow.
