# Product Requirements Document: FORGE Website Redesign

## Document Information
- **Product**: FORGE Framework Documentation Website
- **Version**: 2.0 (Redesign)
- **Date**: August 2025
- **Status**: Draft
- **Priority**: P1 (Critical)

## Executive Summary

The current FORGE Framework website lacks the comprehensive structure and navigational clarity needed to effectively onboard new users and support existing ones. Based on validation analysis comparing the website to the book documentation, we need a complete information architecture redesign and substantial content enhancement to create a world-class developer experience.

## Problem Statement

### Current State Issues
1. **Poor Information Architecture**: Content is scattered across pages with no clear learning progression
2. **Missing Foundational Content**: Lacks compelling value proposition and conceptual explanations
3. **Navigation Problems**: Users can't find what they need or understand where to start
4. **Incomplete Feature Coverage**: Missing documentation for critical features like phase validation
5. **Weak Onboarding**: No clear path from "never heard of FORGE" to "successfully using FORGE"

### User Impact
- **New Users**: Can't understand what FORGE is or why they should use it
- **Existing Users**: Can't find advanced features or troubleshooting help
- **Teams**: No guidance for adoption and collaboration
- **Enterprise**: Missing scalability and integration guidance

### Business Impact
- Reduced adoption due to poor first impressions
