# Test Scenarios: Code Review Recommendations Implementation

**Feature**: implement code review recommendations  
**Created**: 2025-08-21  
**Status**: Draft

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: GitHub Actions Matrix Fix
**Given** a tag is pushed to trigger release workflow  
**When** the test job runs  
**Then** it should use Node 20.x without matrix errors  
**And** all steps complete successfully

### Scenario 2: Non-Interactive Postinstall
**Given** FORGE is installed in CI environment  
**When** `npm install` runs  
**Then** it should complete without prompting for user input  
**And** skip global setup unless explicitly opted in

### Scenario 3: Secure Filename Validation
**Given** a user runs `forge new "../../../etc/passwd"`  
**When** the slug is created  
**Then** it should sanitize to safe characters only  
**And** prevent path traversal outside .forge directory

### Scenario 4: Phase Marker Parsing
**Given** a cycle file with machine-readable phase markers  
**When** `forge status` is called  
**Then** it should correctly identify current phase  
**And** parse progress regardless of cosmetic changes

### Scenario 5: Smoke Test Coverage
**Given** the test suite runs  
**When** basic FORGE commands are tested  
**Then** `init`, `new`, `status`, `complete` should work  
**And** dangerous inputs should be handled safely

### Scenario 6: Linting Compliance
**Given** the codebase is linted  
**When** ESLint runs on core files  
**Then** no errors should be reported  
**And** code style should be consistent

### Scenario 7: Team Status Functionality
**Given** team mode with multiple cycles  
**When** `forge status cycle-name.md` is called  
**Then** it should show that specific cycle's status  
**And** match the documented help text

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] CI workflow completes without matrix errors
- [ ] Postinstall works in non-interactive environments
- [ ] Filename validation prevents security issues
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved

### Should Have  
- [ ] Phase parsing is robust to template changes
- [ ] Basic smoke tests cover critical paths
- [ ] Code passes linting checks
- [ ] Team status commands work as documented

### Could Have
- [ ] Improved error messages
- [ ] Better test coverage
- [ ] Additional security hardening

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- Breaking existing FORGE installations
- CI pipeline failures
- Security vulnerabilities

### Medium Risk
- Performance impact from additional validation
- User experience changes
- Dependency conflicts

### Low Risk
- Cosmetic improvements
- Enhanced error handling
- Better documentation

## Dependencies

### External
- Node.js >=18 requirement
- ESLint for code quality
- GitHub Actions environment

### Internal
- Existing FORGE templates
- Current cycle management
- MCP integration
