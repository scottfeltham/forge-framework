# PRD: FORGE Framework

**Product**: FORGE - AI-Driven Development Framework  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-07-29  
**Status**: Draft

## Executive Summary

FORGE is a radically simplified development framework that guides teams through proven software engineering practices using AI conversation rather than complex tooling. By keeping the CLI concise and minimal while using markdown for all state management, we enable developers to focus on building rather than configuring.

Drawing from Modern Software Engineering principles, the BMAD method's structured approach, and Agent-OS's collaborative AI patterns, FORGE synthesizes these proven concepts into the simplest possible implementation.

## Vision Statement

> "AI should handle complexity, not create it. FORGE provides just enough structure for organization while letting Claude's intelligence drive the development process."

## Problem Statement

Current development frameworks suffer from:

### Complexity Overhead
- Thousands of lines of code
- Complex type systems
- Compilation requirements
- Learning curve measured in days
- Configuration over convention

### Rigid Structure
- Fixed workflows
- Type-safe but inflexible
- Hard to customize
- Requires framework expertise

### AI Integration Challenges
- AI can't easily modify TypeScript
- Complex state management
- Difficult to extend
- Hard-coded behaviors

## Solution Overview

FORGE reimagines the framework as a conversation between developers and AI, with just enough structure to maintain best practices:

### Core Components
1. **Minimal CLI** - Simple commands, concise implementation
2. **Markdown State** - Human and AI readable
3. **Agent Prompts** - Natural language templates
4. **Cycle Management** - Simple phase progression
5. **AI Conversation** - Intelligence over configuration

## Target Users

| Community fragmentation | Medium | Low | Official templates |
| Abandoned for complex tools | Low | Medium | Clear positioning |

## Marketing Strategy

### Positioning
"The minimal framework that replaces complexity"

### Key Messages
1. **Simplicity** - Start building in 30 seconds
2. **AI-Native** - Built for Claude, not against it
3. **Flexible** - Your workflow, your way
4. **Transparent** - See everything, change anything

### Distribution
- GitHub (primary)
- npm registry
- Dev.to articles
- YouTube demos
- Twitter threads

## Success Definition

FORGE succeeds when:
1. Developers choose it for new projects
2. Teams report faster delivery
3. Community actively shares prompts
4. AI development becomes natural
5. Complexity is no longer a barrier

### Comparison Example

#### Traditional Framework
```typescript
interface IAuthService {
  authenticate(credentials: ICredentials): Promise<IUser>;
  logout(session: ISession): Promise<void>;
  refresh(token: IRefreshToken): Promise<IAccessToken>;
}

class AuthService implements IAuthService {
  constructor(
    private readonly userRepo: IUserRepository,
    private readonly tokenService: ITokenService,
    private readonly logger: ILogger
  ) {}
  
  // ... 200 lines of implementation
}
```

#### FORGE
```markdown
## ðŸ”¨ Building Authentication

Claude: I'll help you build authentication. What providers do you need?

User: Google and GitHub OAuth

Claude: As the Architect Agent, here's my plan:
1. Use Passport.js for OAuth
2. Redis for sessions
3. JWT for API tokens

Shall I break this down into tasks?
```

### Philosophy

FORGE believes:
- Conversation > Configuration
- Human-Readable > Machine-Optimized
- AI Guidance > Rigid Rules
- Simplicity > Features
- Outcomes > Process
