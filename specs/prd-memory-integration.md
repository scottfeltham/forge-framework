# PRD: Memory System Integration

**Feature**: AI Memory and Persistent Context  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-07-30  
**Status**: Implemented

## Executive Summary

Enable FORGE to leverage AI memory systems like Claude's memory feature for persistent learning across sessions, creating true continuity in development partnerships between humans and AI.

## Problem Statement

Current AI development tools suffer from session amnesia:
- AI forgets project context between sessions
- Architectural decisions must be re-explained
- Team conventions aren't remembered
- Past solutions aren't recalled
- Every session starts from scratch

This forces developers to repeatedly provide context and prevents AI from becoming a true long-term development partner.

## Solution Overview

Integrate with AI memory systems through CLAUDE.md files and configuration, enabling persistent project context, cross-session learning, and accumulated team knowledge that makes AI assistance progressively more effective.

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- I want Claude to remember our architectural decisions
- I want past solutions automatically suggested for similar problems
- I want consistent code style across sessions
- I want to build on previous conversations, not restart

### As a Team Lead
- I want AI to maintain team conventions
- I want project knowledge to persist across developers
- I want consistent AI behavior for all team members
- I want documented context for onboarding

### As an AI Agent
- I need persistent access to project context
- I need to recall past decisions and their rationale
- I need to maintain consistency across sessions
- I need to learn from accumulated experience

## Functional Requirements

### 1. CLAUDE.md Structure

#### Project Context File
```markdown
# Project Context for Claude

## Project Overview
**Name**: [Project Name]
**Type**: [Web App, API, Library, etc.]
**Tech Stack**: [Technologies used]
**Started**: [Date]

## Architecture Patterns
- [Pattern 1]: [Description]
- [Pattern 2]: [Description]

## Coding Standards
- [Standard 1]
- [Standard 2]

## Key Decisions
1. **[Decision]**: [Rationale]
2. **[Decision]**: [Rationale]

## Key Learnings
- [Learning 1]
- [Learning 2]

## Memory Prompts
When working on this project, remember:
1. [Memory prompt 1]
2. [Memory prompt 2]
```

#### Creation Command
```bash
forge learn claude
# Creates CLAUDE.md from template
# Pre-fills detected information
# Guides memory setup
```

### 2. Memory Configuration

#### forge.yaml Integration
```yaml
learning:
  memory_integration: true
  claude_md: true
  
  memory_prompts:
    - "Remember architectural decisions for this project"
    - "Recall successful patterns and apply them"
    - "Maintain consistency with past conventions"
```

### 3. Memory-Aware Workflows

#### Automatic Context Loading
- AI reads CLAUDE.md on session start
- Applies remembered patterns
- Maintains consistency
- References past decisions

#### Cross-Session Continuity
```
Session 1:
User: We're using the Repository pattern for data access
Claude: I'll remember this architectural decision

Session 2:
Claude: Based on our previous sessions, I'll implement this
        feature using the Repository pattern we established
```

### 4. Learning System Integration

#### Bidirectional Sync
- LEARNINGS.md ↔ Memory
- Patterns documented and remembered
- Failures avoided across sessions
- Success patterns reinforced

#### Memory Enhancement
```
Claude: I recall from memory that database views improved 
        performance by 95% last time. I also see this 
        documented in LEARNINGS.md. Applying this pattern...
```

### 5. Team Memory Sharing

#### Shared Context
- CLAUDE.md in version control
- Team-wide conventions maintained
- Consistent AI behavior
- Knowledge transfer via memory

#### Onboarding Acceleration
New team members get:
- Instant project context
- Historical decisions
- Team conventions
- AI that "knows" the project

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Privacy
- No sensitive data in memory
- Configurable memory scope
- Clear memory boundaries
- Audit trail for memory updates

### Persistence
- Memory survives session ends
- Context preserved long-term
- Graceful degradation without memory
- Backup via CLAUDE.md

### Compatibility
- Works with Claude memory
- Extensible to other AI systems
- Fallback to file-based memory
- No vendor lock-in

## Success Metrics

1. **Context Retention**: 95% of key decisions remembered
2. **Consistency Rate**: 90% consistent patterns across sessions
3. **Onboarding Speed**: 70% faster with memory context
4. **Pattern Application**: 80% of relevant patterns auto-applied
5. **Developer Satisfaction**: 85% report improved AI partnership

## Technical Implementation

### Memory Layers

1. **Persistent Layer** (CLAUDE.md)
   - File-based, version controlled
   - Human readable/editable
   - Project-wide context

2. **Session Memory** (AI Memory)
   - AI-specific memory features
   - Cross-session learning
   - Pattern recognition

3. **Working Memory** (Active Session)
   - Current cycle context
   - Recent decisions
   - Immediate patterns

### Integration Points

```javascript
// Conceptual flow
loadProjectContext() {
  // 1. Read CLAUDE.md
  // 2. Load into AI memory
  // 3. Apply to current session
  // 4. Reference in decisions
}

updateMemory() {
  // 1. Capture new learnings
  // 2. Update AI memory
  // 3. Sync to CLAUDE.md
  // 4. Version control
}
```

### Agent Memory Awareness

All agents updated with:
```markdown
## Memory System Awareness
- Check for CLAUDE.md in project root
- Use memory to recall past decisions
- Remember successful patterns
- Apply cross-session learnings
- State when using remembered context
```

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Memory conflicts | Medium | Clear precedence rules |
| Stale memories | Low | Timestamp and validation |
| Privacy leaks | High | Sensitive data guidelines |
| Memory overload | Medium | Categorization and pruning |

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- ✅ CLAUDE.md template
- ✅ Memory configuration in forge.yaml
- ✅ Agent memory awareness
- ✅ CLI integration
- ✅ Documentation

### Future Enhancements
- Multi-AI memory support
- Memory analytics
- Cross-project memory bridges
- Memory versioning system

## Appendix

### Memory Best Practices

1. **Keep It Focused**
   - Project-specific information only
   - Decisions, not implementations
   - Patterns, not code

2. **Update Regularly**
   - After major decisions
   - When patterns emerge
   - During retrospectives

3. **Security First**
   - No passwords or keys
   - No personal data
   - No internal URLs
   - No sensitive business logic

### Example Memory Usage

```
User: How should we handle authentication?

Claude: I recall from our previous sessions (and confirmed in CLAUDE.md) 
        that this project uses:
        - JWT tokens for API authentication
        - Passport.js for OAuth integration
        - Redis for session storage
        
        This pattern has worked well for our microservices 
        architecture. Should I continue with this approach?
```

### Memory Prompts Examples

```yaml
memory_prompts:
  - "This project prioritizes type safety with TypeScript strict mode"
  - "We follow REST conventions with versioned APIs (/api/v1/)"
  - "All database queries use the Repository pattern"
  - "Security reviews are required for auth changes"
  - "Performance targets: <200ms API response time"
```
