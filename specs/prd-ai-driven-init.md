# PRD: AI-Driven Project Initialization

**Feature**: Pure AI-Powered Project Analysis and Configuration  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-07-30  
**Status**: Implemented

## Executive Summary

Remove all hardcoded project detection logic from the FORGE CLI, instead relying entirely on AI to analyze projects and configure FORGE appropriately, achieving true framework intelligence through conversation rather than code.

## Problem Statement

Traditional framework initialization suffers from:
- Hardcoded detection logic that becomes outdated
- Framework-specific checks that miss new technologies
- Complex detection code that bloats the CLI
- Maintenance burden as ecosystem evolves
- Limited flexibility for edge cases

This violates FORGE's core principle that AI should handle complexity while the CLI remains minimal.

## Solution Overview

Replace all detection logic with a simple file creation step, followed by AI-driven analysis that leverages the AI's ability to understand any project structure, technology stack, or configuration.

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- I want FORGE to work with any project type without updates
- I want intelligent detection of my actual setup
- I want configuration that matches my specific needs
- I want the process to feel magical, not mechanical

### As a Framework Maintainer
- I want zero maintenance for detection logic
- I want the framework to improve as AI improves
- I want to avoid framework-specific assumptions
- I want true simplicity in the codebase

### As an AI Agent
- I need to analyze project structure comprehensively
- I need to detect frameworks and tools accurately
- I need to generate appropriate configuration
- I need to explain my analysis clearly

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Minimal CLI Behavior

#### forge init Command
```javascript
init: () => {
  // Check if already initialized
  if (fs.existsSync('forge.yaml')) {
    console.log('⚠️  FORGE is already initialized');
    return;
  }
  
  // Create minimal config
  const minimalConfig = `# FORGE Framework Configuration
project: ${path.basename(process.cwd())}
description: AI-powered development with FORGE

mode: conversational

# Let AI analyze and expand this configuration
`;
  
  fs.writeFileSync('forge.yaml', minimalConfig);
  fs.mkdirSync('.forge', { recursive: true });
  
  // Create analysis prompt for AI
  fs.writeFileSync('.forge/INIT_ANALYSIS.md', analysisPrompt);
  
  console.log('🔨 FORGE initialized!');
  console.log('🤖 AI Project Analysis Triggered...');
}
```

### 2. AI Analysis Process

#### Analysis Prompt Template
```markdown
# FORGE Project Analysis Request

As the FORGE Project Analyzer, please analyze this project:

1. **Explore Project Structure**
   - Use LS to examine directories
   - Check for source code locations
   - Identify configuration files

2. **Detect Technologies**
   - Read package.json, go.mod, Cargo.toml, etc.
   - Identify primary language
   - Find frameworks and libraries
   - Detect testing tools

3. **Check Existing Setups**
   - Look for .claude/ directory
   - Check for CLAUDE.md
   - Find CI/CD configurations
   - Identify development tools

4. **Update forge.yaml**
   - Add detected technologies
   - Configure appropriate settings
   - Set agent preferences
   - Enable relevant features

5. **Create CLAUDE.md**
   - Document project context
   - Include architecture patterns
   - Add coding standards
   - Set memory prompts
```

### 3. AI-Driven Detection

#### No Hardcoded Checks
- No `if (package.dependencies.react)`
- No framework-specific logic
- No version parsing
- No assumption validation

#### Universal Analysis
AI can detect:
- Any programming language
- Any framework or library
- Any project structure
- Any tool or service
- Future technologies

### 4. Configuration Generation

#### Dynamic forge.yaml
AI generates based on findings:
```yaml
# Generated by AI analysis
project: my-app
description: React TypeScript application with PostgreSQL

detected:
  - react 18.2
  - typescript
  - postgresql
  - jest
  - github-actions

# AI-determined configuration
ai:
  primary: claude
  model: sonnet

agents:
  dynamic: true
  suggested:
    - frontend-developer
    - api-developer
    - database-specialist
```

### 5. Continuous Intelligence

#### Self-Improving System
- As AI models improve, detection improves
- New technologies automatically supported
- Better pattern recognition over time
- No code updates needed

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Simplicity
- CLI remains under 100 lines
- No detection logic in code
- Pure file operations only
- Complexity in conversation

### Flexibility
- Works with any technology
- Adapts to any structure
- Handles edge cases gracefully
- No assumptions or limits

### Future-Proof
- Supports technologies that don't exist yet
- Improves without updates
- Leverages AI advancement
- Zero maintenance burden

## Success Metrics

1. **Detection Accuracy**: 95% correct technology identification
2. **Configuration Quality**: 90% optimal settings on first run
3. **New Tech Support**: 100% (works with anything)
4. **Maintenance Hours**: 0 hours for detection updates
5. **User Satisfaction**: 85% "magical" experience rating

## Technical Implementation

### CLI Simplicity
```javascript
// Entire init implementation
init: () => {
  if (fs.existsSync('forge.yaml')) {
    console.log('Already initialized');
    return;
  }
  
  // Create files
  fs.writeFileSync('forge.yaml', minimalTemplate);
  fs.mkdirSync('.forge', { recursive: true });
  fs.writeFileSync('.forge/INIT_ANALYSIS.md', analysisPrompt);
  
  console.log('🔨 Initialized! AI will analyze...');
}
```

### AI Analysis Flow
1. AI reads analysis prompt
2. Explores project with tools
3. Detects everything relevant
4. Updates configuration
5. Creates documentation
6. Provides summary

### Project Analyzer Agent
Specialized agent for initialization:
- Expert at project analysis
- Knows common patterns
- Generates optimal configs
- Explains findings clearly

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| AI misses something | Low | Developer can manually add |
| Analysis takes time | Low | Show progress indicators |
| Inconsistent analysis | Medium | Structured prompt template |
| No internet for AI | High | Minimal config works offline |
