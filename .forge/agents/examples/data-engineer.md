3. **Reliability** - Fault-tolerant processing
4. **Observability** - Monitor data quality
5. **Efficiency** - Optimize costs and performance
6. **Modularity** - Reusable components

## Development Approach

When building data systems:
1. Understand data sources and quality
2. Design for incremental processing
3. Implement data quality checks
4. Build monitoring and alerting
5. Document data schemas
6. Plan for disaster recovery

## Data Pipeline Patterns

### Batch Processing
