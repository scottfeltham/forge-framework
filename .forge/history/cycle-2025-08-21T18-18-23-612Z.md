## 📝 Notes

### Requirements
**High Priority:**
1. Fix GitHub Actions test job matrix issue - CI fails due to undefined matrix
2. Make postinstall non-interactive - Hangs in CI and surprises users

**Medium Priority:**
3. Add robust filename/slug validation - Prevent path traversal attacks
4. Add phase markers to templates - Make parsing more reliable  
5. Add smoke tests and linting - Improve code quality and reliability
6. Update Node engine requirement - Align with CI (>=18 vs >=14)
7. Fix team status UX mismatch - Help text doesn't match functionality

### Test Scenarios [MANDATORY - Must be completed in Focus phase]
*Link to test scenarios: [specs/test-scenarios-code-review-fixes.md]*
<!-- Test scenarios MUST be defined before any code is written -->
<!-- Use templates/test-scenarios.md as a guide -->
<!-- NO IMPLEMENTATION WITHOUT TEST SCENARIOS -->

### PRD Reference
*Link to PRD: [Not yet created]*
<!-- PRDs are stored in specs/ directory -->
<!-- Naming convention: prd-{{feature-name}}.md -->

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Backward Compatibility**: All changes maintain existing API surface
2. **Incremental Enhancement**: Use machine-readable markers alongside legacy parsing
3. **CI-First Security**: Detect non-interactive environments automatically  
4. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of filename validation
5. **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Conservative behavior when environment unclear

### Parallel Task Opportunities
*Identify tasks that can be executed in parallel using subagents*
<!-- Use templates/parallel-tasks.md for complex features -->
<!-- Consider parallel execution for:
     - Multi-aspect analysis (technical, security, performance)
     - Independent component development
     - Different test types (unit, integration, e2e)
     - Documentation tasks (generation, auditing, formatting)
-->

### Risks Identified
**High Risk:**
- Breaking existing FORGE installations during upgrade
- CI pipeline failures due to dependency changes

**Medium Risk:**  
- Performance impact from additional validation overhead
- User confusion from behavior changes in postinstall

**Low Risk:**
- Template compatibility with existing cycles
- Linting rule conflicts with existing code style

### Tasks

**Priority 1 (High Risk - Must Fix):**
1. Fix GitHub Actions matrix issue (.github/workflows/release.yml)
2. Make postinstall non-interactive (install.js)

**Priority 2 (Medium Risk - Security/Quality):**
3. Add filename validation to forge script (createSlug function) 
4. Add phase markers to cycle template (templates/cycle.md)
5. Update phase parsing logic (forge script parsePhaseProgress)

**Priority 3 (Quality Improvements):**
6. Create smoke test suite (test-smoke.js)
7. Add ESLint configuration (.eslintrc.json)
8. Update package.json scripts and engine requirement

**Priority 4 (UX Fix):**
9. Fix team status command (forge status function)

**Dependencies:**
- Tasks 1-2 are independent and can be done in parallel
- Task 4 must be done before task 5 (template before parsing)
- Tasks 6-7 can be done in parallel
- All tasks are backwards compatible

## 📊 Evaluation Results

### Success Metrics
| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| High priority issues resolved | 2/2 | 2/2 | ✅ |
| Medium priority issues resolved | 5/5 | 5/5 | ✅ |
| Tests passing | 100% | 100% (7/7) | ✅ |
| Linting errors | 0 | 0 | ✅ |
| Breaking changes | 0 | 0 | ✅ |
| Core code size | <200 lines | <200 lines | ✅ |
| CI workflow fixed | Yes | Yes | ✅ |

### What Worked Well
- **Following FORGE methodology properly**: This time I went through all phases systematically
- **Comprehensive code review analysis**: The external review provided excellent prioritized guidance
- **Test-driven implementation**: Created test scenarios before implementation
- **Automated quality checks**: ESLint caught style issues automatically
- **Backward compatibility**: All changes preserve existing functionality
- **Security-first approach**: Input validation and CI detection prevent vulnerabilities

### What Didn't Work
- **Initial implementation bypass**: In previous session, I implemented without following FORGE phases
- **Phase transition automation**: The `forge phase next` command skipped phases (needs refinement)
- **Test dependency copying**: Initial smoke tests failed due to missing node_modules
- **Minor linting violations**: Required auto-fix for code style consistency

### Key Learnings
- **Process discipline matters**: Even when familiar with requirements, following structured phases prevents mistakes
- **External reviews are valuable**: The agent-generated code review identified issues I missed
- **Test isolation is critical**: Tests must be truly self-contained with all dependencies
- **CI-first security**: Non-interactive modes prevent deployment hangs and security issues
- **Machine-readable markers**: Template parsing is more robust with explicit markers vs text parsing

### Recommendations for Next Cycle
- Fix `forge phase next` logic to respect mandatory tasks in current phase
- Add more comprehensive integration tests beyond smoke tests
- Consider adding pre-commit hooks for linting
- Add performance benchmarks for slug validation overhead
- Create automated security scanning for input validation
- Document the new phase marker system for template creators
