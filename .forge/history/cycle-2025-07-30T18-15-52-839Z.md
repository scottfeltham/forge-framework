**Status**: Focus Phase  
**Owner**: {{OWNER}}  
**Team**: {{TEAM_MEMBERS}}

## 📋 Progress

### Phase 1: Focus 🎯 [Complete]
- [x] Gather requirements
- [x] Define test scenarios (MANDATORY)
- [x] Create/Update PRD in specs/
- [ ] Parallel Analysis (if complex):
  - [ ] Technical feasibility (subagent)
  - [ ] Security implications (subagent)
  - [ ] Performance impact (subagent)
- [x] Design architecture
- [x] Identify risks

### Phase 2: Orchestrate 📝 [Pending]
- [ ] Break down tasks
- [ ] Assign priorities
- [ ] Plan dependencies

### Phase 3: Refine 🔨 [Pending]
- [ ] Implement features
  - [ ] Consider parallel implementation for independent components
- [ ] Write tests
  - [ ] Consider parallel test types (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Code review

### Phase 4: Generate 🚀 [Pending]
- [ ] Build artifacts
- [ ] Prepare deployment
- [ ] Update documentation

### Phase 5: Evaluate 📊 [Pending]
- [ ] Measure success metrics
- [ ] Gather stakeholder feedback
- [ ] Conduct retrospective
- [ ] Document learnings
- [ ] Update knowledge base
- [ ] Plan improvements

## 📝 Notes

### Requirements
- Trigger on tag creation (semantic versioning tags like v1.0.0)
- Build npm package automatically
- Run tests before release
- Generate release notes from commits
- Publish to npm registry
- Create GitHub release with artifacts
- Support both stable and beta releases
- Automated changelog generation
- Security scanning before release
- Cross-platform build verification

### Test Scenarios [MANDATORY - Must be completed in Focus phase]
Link to test scenarios: [templates/test-scenarios-release-automation.md](../templates/test-scenarios-release-automation.md)
<!-- Test scenarios MUST be defined before any code is written -->
<!-- Use templates/test-scenarios.md as a guide -->
<!-- NO IMPLEMENTATION WITHOUT TEST SCENARIOS -->

### PRD Reference
Link to PRD: [specs/prd-github-release-automation.md](../specs/prd-github-release-automation.md)
<!-- PRDs are stored in specs/ directory -->
<!-- Naming convention: prd-{{feature-name}}.md -->

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Single Workflow File**: `release.yml` handles entire release pipeline
   - Triggered by version tags (v*)
   - Single source of truth for release process
   - Easy to maintain and debug

2. **Matrix Strategy**: Test across multiple environments
   - OS: ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest
   - Node: LTS versions (18.x, 20.x)
   - Ensures compatibility before release

3. **Job Dependencies**: Sequential flow with gates
   - test → build → security-scan → publish → release
   - Fail fast on any step
   - Clear progress visibility

4. **Changelog Generation**: Conventional commits based
   - Use `conventional-changelog` for consistency
   - Group changes by type
   - Generate markdown format

5. **Security Scanning**: Multi-layer approach
   - `npm audit` for dependencies
   - Secret scanning
   - SAST tools integration optional

6. **Release Assets**: Include key artifacts
   - Source tarball
   - npm package tarball
   - Changelog
   - Security report

### Risks Identified

1. **Token Security** (High)
   - NPM_TOKEN exposure risk
   - Mitigation: Use GitHub secrets, minimal permissions, rotate regularly

2. **Bad Release Published** (High)
   - Broken package reaching users
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive test matrix, staged rollout for major versions

3. **Platform-Specific Issues** (Medium)
   - Package works on Linux but fails on Windows
   - Mitigation: Matrix testing across all platforms

4. **npm Registry Downtime** (Low)
   - Can't publish during outage
   - Mitigation: Retry logic, status checks

5. **Large Release Assets** (Low)
   - GitHub release upload limits
   - Mitigation: Asset size optimization, chunking if needed

### Parallel Task Opportunities
For the Orchestrate phase:
- Platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux in parallel)
- Security scans (dependency audit, secret scanning, SAST)
- Documentation generation (changelog, API docs, release notes)
- Asset building (source tarball, npm package, checksums)
