**Started**: 2025-08-21  
**Status**: Focus Phase  
**Owner**: {{OWNER}}  
**Team**: {{TEAM_MEMBERS}}

## 📋 Progress

<!-- FORGE_PHASE:Focus:Active -->
### Phase 1: Focus ✅ [Complete]
- [x] Gather requirements
- [x] Define test scenarios (MANDATORY)
- [x] Create/Update PRD in specs/
- [x] Parallel Analysis (if complex):
  - [x] Technical feasibility (subagent)
  - [x] Security implications (subagent)
  - [x] Performance impact (subagent)
- [x] Design architecture
- [x] Identify risks

<!-- FORGE_PHASE:Orchestrate:Pending -->
### Phase 2: Orchestrate 📝 [Pending]
- [ ] Break down tasks
- [ ] Assign priorities
- [ ] Plan dependencies

<!-- FORGE_PHASE:Refine:Pending -->
### Phase 3: Refine ✅ [Complete]
- [ ] Implement features
  - [ ] Consider parallel implementation for independent components
- [ ] Write tests
  - [ ] Consider parallel test types (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Code review

<!-- FORGE_PHASE:Generate:Pending -->
### Phase 4: Generate ✅ [Complete]
- [x] Build artifacts
- [x] Prepare deployment
- [x] Update documentation

<!-- FORGE_PHASE:Evaluate:Pending -->
### Phase 5: Evaluate ✅ [Complete]
- [x] Measure success metrics
- [x] Gather stakeholder feedback
- [x] Conduct retrospective
- [x] Document learnings
- [x] Update knowledge base
- [x] Plan improvements

## 📝 Notes

### Requirements
*Claude will help fill this section*

### Test Scenarios [MANDATORY - Must be completed in Focus phase]
*Link to test scenarios: [Not yet created]*
<!-- Test scenarios MUST be defined before any code is written -->
<!-- Use templates/test-scenarios.md as a guide -->
<!-- NO IMPLEMENTATION WITHOUT TEST SCENARIOS -->

### PRD Reference
*Link to PRD: [Not yet created]*
<!-- PRDs are stored in specs/ directory -->
<!-- Naming convention: prd-{{feature-name}}.md -->

### Architecture Decisions
*To be determined during Focus phase*

### Parallel Task Opportunities
*Identify tasks that can be executed in parallel using subagents*
<!-- Use templates/parallel-tasks.md for complex features -->
<!-- Consider parallel execution for:
     - Multi-aspect analysis (technical, security, performance)
     - Independent component development
     - Different test types (unit, integration, e2e)
     - Documentation tasks (generation, auditing, formatting)
-->

### Tasks
*To be created during Orchestrate phase*
