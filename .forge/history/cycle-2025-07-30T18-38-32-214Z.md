## 📝 Notes

### Requirements
- Trigger on tag creation (semantic versioning tags like v1.0.0)
- Build npm package automatically
- Run tests before release
- Generate release notes from commits
- Publish to npm registry
- Create GitHub release with artifacts
- Support both stable and beta releases
- Automated changelog generation
- Security scanning before release
- Cross-platform build verification

### Test Scenarios [MANDATORY - Must be completed in Focus phase]
Link to test scenarios: [templates/test-scenarios-release-automation.md](../templates/test-scenarios-release-automation.md)
<!-- Test scenarios MUST be defined before any code is written -->
<!-- Use templates/test-scenarios.md as a guide -->
<!-- NO IMPLEMENTATION WITHOUT TEST SCENARIOS -->

### PRD Reference
Link to PRD: [specs/prd-github-release-automation.md](../specs/prd-github-release-automation.md)
<!-- PRDs are stored in specs/ directory -->
<!-- Naming convention: prd-{{feature-name}}.md -->

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Single Workflow File**: `release.yml` handles entire release pipeline
   - Triggered by version tags (v*)
   - Single source of truth for release process
   - Easy to maintain and debug

2. **Matrix Strategy**: Test across multiple environments
   - OS: ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest
   - Node: LTS versions (18.x, 20.x)
   - Ensures compatibility before release

3. **Job Dependencies**: Sequential flow with gates
   - test → build → security-scan → publish → release
   - Fail fast on any step
   - Clear progress visibility

4. **Changelog Generation**: Conventional commits based
   - Use `conventional-changelog` for consistency
   - Group changes by type
   - Generate markdown format

5. **Security Scanning**: Multi-layer approach
   - `npm audit` for dependencies
   - Secret scanning
   - SAST tools integration optional

6. **Release Assets**: Include key artifacts
   - Source tarball
   - npm package tarball
   - Changelog
   - Security report

### Risks Identified

1. **Token Security** (High)
   - NPM_TOKEN exposure risk
   - Mitigation: Use GitHub secrets, minimal permissions, rotate regularly

2. **Bad Release Published** (High)
   - Broken package reaching users
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive test matrix, staged rollout for major versions

3. **Platform-Specific Issues** (Medium)
   - Package works on Linux but fails on Windows
   - Mitigation: Matrix testing across all platforms

4. **npm Registry Downtime** (Low)
   - Can't publish during outage
   - Mitigation: Retry logic, status checks

5. **Large Release Assets** (Low)
   - GitHub release upload limits
   - Mitigation: Asset size optimization, chunking if needed

### Parallel Task Opportunities
For the Orchestrate phase:
- Platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux in parallel)
- Security scans (dependency audit, secret scanning, SAST)
- Documentation generation (changelog, API docs, release notes)
- Asset building (source tarball, npm package, checksums)

## 📊 Evaluation Results

### Success Metrics
| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Workflow Creation Time | < 3 days | 1 day | ✅ Exceeded |
| Test Coverage | All platforms | Win/Mac/Linux + Node 18/20 | ✅ Met |
| Security Scanning | Implemented | npm audit + TruffleHog | ✅ Met |
| Automation Level | 100% | Full pipeline automated | ✅ Met |
| Error Handling | Retry logic | 3x retry with backoff | ✅ Met |
| Documentation | Complete | Guide + test script | ✅ Met |

### What Worked Well
- **FORGE Process**: The 5-phase approach provided clear structure and progress tracking
- **Test-Driven Design**: Writing test scenarios first ensured comprehensive coverage
- **Matrix Strategy**: Cross-platform testing configuration was straightforward with GitHub Actions
- **Conventional Commits**: Made changelog generation automatic and consistent
- **Code Review**: Caught several edge cases (empty tags, regex issues, retry logic)
- **Documentation First**: Creating the PRD helped clarify all requirements upfront

### What Didn't Work
- **Initial Completion**: Accidentally marked code review as done without actually doing it
- **Cycle Management**: Accidentally completed the cycle prematurely with `forge complete`
- **Git State**: Test script detected uncommitted changes, showing need for better git integration

### Key Learnings
1. **GitHub Actions Power**: Matrix builds, job dependencies, and outputs make complex workflows manageable
2. **Error Handling Critical**: Network failures are common; retry logic is essential for reliability
3. **First Release Edge Case**: Must handle scenarios where there's no previous tag for changelog
4. **Security First**: Including security scanning early prevents issues later
5. **Test Scripts Valuable**: Local validation script helps developers verify setup before pushing

### Recommendations for Next Cycle
1. **Add Version Bumping**: Create workflow to automatically bump version based on commit types
2. **Enhance Changelog**: Use a proper changelog generator like `conventional-changelog-cli`
3. **Add Rollback Workflow**: Automated rollback mechanism for bad releases
4. **NPM 2FA Support**: Handle npm's 2FA requirements for enhanced security
5. **Release Notifications**: Add Slack/Discord notifications for release status
6. **Signed Releases**: Implement GPG signing for release artifacts
7. **Performance Metrics**: Track release pipeline duration and optimize bottlenecks
