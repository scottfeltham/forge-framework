# Cycle: {{FEATURE}}

**Created**: {{DATE}}
**Priority**: {{PRIORITY}}
**Status**: Active

## Overview

<!-- Describe what this cycle aims to accomplish -->

---

<!-- FORGE_PHASE:Focus:Active -->
## Phase 1: Focus 🎯

**Purpose**: Define what you're building and why.

### Required Outputs
- [ ] Problem statement and target users defined
- [ ] Testable success criteria written
- [ ] System Context diagram (C4 L1) created
- [ ] Clear boundaries on what you WON'T build

### Notes

<!-- Document Focus phase work here -->

---

<!-- FORGE_PHASE:Orchestrate:Pending -->
## Phase 2: Orchestrate 📋

**Purpose**: Break the work into session-sized pieces.

### Required Outputs
- [ ] Container architecture (C4 L2) designed
- [ ] Component architecture (C4 L3) designed
- [ ] Dependency map created
- [ ] Tasks sized for single AI sessions

### Tasks

<!-- List tasks here -->

---

<!-- FORGE_PHASE:Refine:Pending -->
## Phase 3: Refine ✏️

**Purpose**: Define exactly what "done" looks like.

**CRITICAL**: No code in this phase - specifications only.

### Required Outputs
- [ ] Acceptance criteria in Given-When-Then format
- [ ] Interface specifications documented
- [ ] Edge cases enumerated by category
- [ ] Constraints vs criteria documented

### Acceptance Criteria

<!-- For each task, use Given-When-Then format:
Given [starting situation]
When [action is taken]
Then [expected outcome]
-->

### Interface Specifications

<!-- Document inputs, outputs, and error contracts -->

### Edge Cases

| Category | Cases |
|----------|-------|
| Empty/null | |
| Boundary | |
| Invalid | |
| Timing | |
| Failure | |

---

<!-- FORGE_PHASE:Generate:Pending -->
## Phase 4: Generate ⚡

**Purpose**: AI writes code following TDD.

### Process
- [ ] RED: Write failing tests
- [ ] GREEN: Minimal code to pass
- [ ] REFACTOR: Improve while green

### Rules
- One task per AI session
- Tests BEFORE implementation
- 80% minimum coverage

### Implementation Notes

<!-- Document implementation progress here -->

---

<!-- FORGE_PHASE:Evaluate:Pending -->
## Phase 5: Evaluate ✅

**Purpose**: Verify output matches intent.

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Criteria verified line-by-line
- [ ] Edge cases tested
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Integration tested

### Disposition

<!-- Choose one:
- **Accept**: Meets all criteria - complete cycle
- **Accept with issues**: Works but has minor issues - document and plan fixes
- **Revise**: Doesn't meet criteria - back to Generate
- **Reject**: Fundamental problems - back to Focus
