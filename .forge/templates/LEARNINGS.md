# FORGE Project Learnings

This knowledge base captures learnings from all completed cycles. It grows with each project iteration and helps inform future decisions.

## üéØ Patterns That Work

### Architecture Patterns
<!-- Add successful architectural decisions -->
*Example: Microservices work well for features that scale independently*

### Development Practices
<!-- Add effective development approaches -->
*Example: TDD reduced bug count by 40% in payment features*

### Technology Choices
<!-- Add technology decisions that proved successful -->
*Example: Redis for session management scaled better than database sessions*

### Team Collaboration
<!-- Add successful collaboration patterns -->
*Example: Daily standup at cycle boundaries improved handoffs*

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Pitfalls to Avoid

### Common Mistakes
<!-- Document what didn't work -->
*Example: Skipping integration tests led to production issues*

### Anti-Patterns
<!-- Document approaches to avoid -->
*Example: Over-engineering simple features delayed delivery*

### Technical Debt Sources
<!-- Identify what creates debt -->
*Example: Rushing deployment without proper monitoring*

## üîß Technology Decisions

### Approved Stack
| Category | Technology | Reasoning |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| *Example: Frontend* | *React* | *Team expertise, ecosystem* |

### Rejected Options
| Technology | Reason for Rejection | Alternative |
|------------|---------------------|-------------|
| *Example: MongoDB* | *Need ACID transactions* | *PostgreSQL* |

## üìà Metrics & Benchmarks

### Performance Benchmarks
| Metric | Target | Best Achieved | Typical |
|--------|--------|---------------|---------|
| *API Response* | *<200ms* | *150ms* | *180ms* |

### Quality Metrics
| Metric | Target | Current Average |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| *Test Coverage* | *80%* | *85%* |
| *Bug Rate* | *<5/sprint* | *3/sprint* |

## üöÄ Best Practices

### Code Review
- [ ] Always review PR within 24 hours
- [ ] Focus on architecture over syntax
- [ ] Provide actionable feedback

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Write tests first for critical paths
- [ ] Integration tests for API boundaries
- [ ] E2E tests for user journeys

### Deployment Process
- [ ] Always have rollback plan
- [ ] Deploy during low-traffic hours
- [ ] Monitor for 30 minutes post-deploy
